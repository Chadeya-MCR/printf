This repository contains files for the printf group project

The first file is a customized implentation of standard printf function which allows us to print foramatted output to the standard stream.

The second file supports two additional conversions specifiers for instance %d an %i for printing signed integers

The third file allows to print format string with specific conversions ie %c %s %d %i and %% this custom '_printf'
